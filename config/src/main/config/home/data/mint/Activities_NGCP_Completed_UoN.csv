This instrument, initially purchased in 2005, has established Newcastle as a leading centre for proteomics research (4 papers in 'Proteomics' in 2007). However, if we are to retain this position we need an instrument with greater accuracy, sensitivity and versatility.  The latter is particularly important because there is high demand for improved facilities to isolate and characterize organic compounds in the context of 'metabolomics', forensic science, natural products, medicinal chemistry, biosensor development and organic electronics.

Organelles are essential cell components and thus continued cell division requires that each daughter cell inherit these organelles. In plants, partitioning of organelles between daughter cells is an actin cytoskeleton dependent event. However, the molecular mechanisms of organelle partitioning and the processes that ensure intactness of organelle genomes are unknown.

This will provide more accurate predictions and robust quantification of predictive uncertainty at ungauged basins.,The University of Newcastle,Prof GA Kuczera; Dr MA Thyer; A/Prof SW Franks,NSWDP0773279,2006,2007,Application of novel exact combinatorial optimisation techniques and metaheuristic methods for problems in cancer research,"The design and analysis of computer algorithms is vital in the challenging field of knowledge extraction from large-scale datasets coming obtained with high-throughput technologies in cancer research. Computer scientists propose new mathematical models based on combinatorial optimization. Many of these problems are deemed 'computationally intractable', yet it is imperative to address them and to provide high-quality solutions.

Paradoxically, this has placed tremendous pressure on existing empirical design methodology. This has provided the possibility to design much better systems through the development of a better understanding of conveyor mechanics. This project is focused on this aim. Our approach to building a new foundation for conveyor design will be based on the application of advanced viscoelastic and Mohr-Coulomb continuum models to the interaction between the material, the belt and the idlers.

It will test empirically the hypothesis that the law works better stated in the form of broad principles rather than detailed rules. This hypothesis is based on the results of a prior ARC project. It is controversial because it contradicts a widely held belief, shared by the current High Court of Australia, that the contrary is true. Debate on this subject has endured for over 200 years. It has hitherto been conducted in purely theoretical terms. Large claims of benefit to the law and society can be made on both sides.

Treated municipal effluent is often land applied and used to grow hardwood plantations. Hardwood plantations are very effective in producing large amounts of biomass and also assist agencies in off-setting wastewater treatment and disposal costs associated with advanced wastewater treatment to remove nutrients. This project will examine the effects of effluent irrigation on soil chemistry and groundwater quality at two hardwood plantations in the Hunter Valley, NSW. It is increasingly clear that large-scale reuse schemes, particularly those involving hardwood plantations, must be designed to be sustainable and have no significant impact on soil chemistry (increasing sodicity) and grou",The University of Newcastle,Mr PM Geary Dr R Drysdale,NSWLP0218930,2001,2002,Free Surface Instability and Gas Entrainment during Blast Furnace Drainage,Iron and Steelmaking operations have underpinned Australia's industry base for many years. To remain competitive in a global market BHP has undertaken considerable research and development to constantly improve process performance. An area of on-going concern is the unexpected release of gas during Blast Furnace drainage resulting in hazardous conditions for the operators and overall loss of production. This project aims to identify the causes of gas release and to devise operational strategies and design modifications to prevent this occurrence. Once implemented the outcomes of the research will be a more stable operation leading to increased production and less environmental emissions.,The University of Newcastle,A/Prof GM Evans Dr P Zulli,NSWLP0219252,2001,2002,Gassing Mechanism and Stability of Foamed Explosive Emulsions,"Mining of minerals such as coal involves crushing the surrounding rock strata, or the mineral ore itself, with emulsion explosives.  One of the most important properties determining suitability of an emulsion explosive to a particular mining operation is its velocity of detonation, which can be adjusted by varying the number and size of air bubbles distributed in the emulsion matrix.  The present project aims to develop new ways of generating air bubbles, to gain fundamental understanding of the foaming mechanism in currently used gassing techniques, and to invent ways to stabilise large bubbles within the emulsion.  The project will provide scientific underpinning for the development of a new range of emulsion explosives manufactured by Orica for Australian and international markets, maintaining the Orica's position as a leader in the field of emulsion explosives.",The University of Newcastle,A/Prof BZ Dlugogorski Dr EM Kennedy Dr RJ Goodridge,NSWLP0219327,2001,2002,Use of Gradipore technology to develop novel methods for the preparation and segregation of mammalian spermatozoa,"The purpose of this project is to harness the expertise available within an Australian biotechnology company, Gradipore, to develop novel methods for the preparation of mammalian spermatozoa and the segregation of these cells into X-and Y- bearing populations. This technology will find application in: (1)clinical andrology, where rapid, safe protocols for the preparation and segregation of human spermatozoa are being actively sought in the context of assisted conception and the management of sex-linked genetic diseases and (2) agriculture, particularly the cattle industry, where a capacity to predetermine the sex of the offspring would be extremely valuable.",The University of Newcastle,Prof RJ Aitken Dr DB Rylatt,NSWLP0219565,2001,2002,A Generic Software Architecture for Web-Based Applications on Micro-Mobile Systems,"The next generation of computers that will capture the imagination of the society are likely to be micro-mobile devices such as personal digital assistants, mobile phones, smartcards and chips embedded in home and office items.

Dynamical systems are an abstraction of physical  systems suitable for studying time evolution and symmetries. The project aims to determine when important representations of dynamical systems are faithful, or, in mathematical language, when the dynamical system is amenable. The proposed strategy involves extending Rieffel's notion of proper actions; the construction should be of wide applicability apart from the intended applications to amenability.",The University of Newcastle,Prof I Raeburn Dr A an Huef Prof DP Williams,NSWLX0239962,2001,2002,Ground based monitoring of plasma dynamics in the magnetosphere,"We will use a new technique to study the plasmapause, a fundamental and highly dynamic boundary in geospace.  This is usually examined using spacecraft and ground-based VLF measurements, but these suffer several limitations.  We have developed the ability to monitor plasma density in geospace, by measuring the resonant frequency of geomagnetic field line oscillations.  This project will use data from extensive ground magnetometer arrays to thus study the spatial and temporal variation in particle density near the plasmapause.  Comparison with VLF and spacecraft measurements will provide new information on the plasma composition and dynamics in this important region.",The University of Newcastle,A/Prof FW Menk Dr IR Mann,NSW
