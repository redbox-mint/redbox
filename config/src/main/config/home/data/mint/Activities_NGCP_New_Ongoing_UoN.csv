Conventional methods do not work because of the high cooling rates required to maintain amorphousness. This research, which consists of novel experimental and computational components, investigates highly reactive foils for the purposes of joining amorphous alloys. It is anticipated that the research will lay the foundation for a robust and reliable means for joining these materials and facilitate their uptake in technology.
